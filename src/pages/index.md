## What is Gospel Exploder?

This (opiniated) [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) starter is based on [Andy Bell's](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_) talk 'Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager' and it's companion website buildexcellentwebsit.es.

In his words, it's about hinting the browser rather than micromanaging it, using progressive enhancement, CSS layout, fluid type & spacing, as well as modern CSS features.

This way we can shape frontends that look good to everyone, regardless of device, connection speed or context.
